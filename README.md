# Terminal Calculator with Functions

**Project Description:**

This is a continuation of my previous calculator project. While this calculator is still terminal-based, it has been enhanced with a menu feature, making it more interactive. Users can choose from various mathematical operations via the menu, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. This calculator will keep running until the user chooses to exit.

**How to Use the Calculator:**

1. Run the calculator program by executing this Java file.

2. The program will display a menu with options for mathematical operations.

3. Choose the operation you want by entering the corresponding number.

4. Follow the instructions to input the numbers to be operated on.

5. The program will calculate the result of the operation and display it.

6. You can continue to perform mathematical operations or exit the calculator.

**Calculator Functions:**

- **Addition**: Adds two numbers.
